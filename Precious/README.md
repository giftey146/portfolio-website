Setup Instructions
Clone or Download: Download the project files to your local machine.
Open in Browser: Open index.html in a web browser to view the homepage. Navigate to other pages using the sticky navigation bar.
Customize:
Replace the placeholder image in index.html (<img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random/600x600/?tech,portrait" alt="Precious Diana">) with a personal photo.
Update the placeholder links (e.g., "View Project", social media links, "Download My CV") with actual URLs.
Modify content in each HTML file as needed to reflect updated information.
Usage
Navigation: Use the sticky navigation bar at the top to switch between pages (Home, About, Education, Skills, Projects, Contact).
Interactivity: Hover over cards and buttons to see tilt and neon glow effects. The homepage features a typing animation in the hero section.
Competition Ready: The design is optimized for a competition, with a focus on visual appeal, creativity, and functionality using only HTML5 and CSS3.
Notes
Limitations:
The newsletter form is static (disabled) as JavaScript is not used.
Scroll-reveal animations are simulated using CSS keyframes since true scroll detection requires JavaScript.
Parallax effects on the homepage may not work on some mobile devices due to browser limitations.
Customization:
Update the social media links in the footer with actual URLs.
Adjust the color scheme in the CSS files if desired (current palette: #1a0033, #ff69b4, #00ffcc).
Testing: Test the website on different devices and browsers to ensure compatibility.
